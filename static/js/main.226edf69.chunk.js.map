Throughout the Revolution GW sought to regain New York from British Occupation, but his re-entry into the city would not occur until British evacuation on November 25th 1783. On December 4th, Washington bid farewell to his officers and public service in the Long Room of Fraunces Tavern. Yet, New York City beckoned him back into public life as Federal Hall (at the intersection of Broad and Wall St.) served as his inauguration site and the city as the nation’s new temporary capital in 1789.

In 1756, twenty-four-year-old Colonel George Washington first arrived to the blusting port city of New York as a crossover on a journey to and from Boston. A surveyor and seasoned soldier from Virginia, Washington was to meet with British commander-in-chief Governor William Shirley of Massachusetts, to discuss the terms of his commission within the Royal Army. At this point in time, the British Empire was engulfed in an imperial crisis against the French, known as the Seven Years’ War or by the name given to the North American theatre: The French and Indian War (1754 - 1763).' },\n  { title:\n     'STOP #2 Ratzer Map (Confidential): A Young Colonel in New York (1756)',\n    slide:\n     '2. (HANDOUT GW in Virginia Regiment Uniform and Journal title page) Washington was an established public figure and author upon his arrival to New York City. The widely read Journal of Major George Washington (1754) was Washington’s personal account of his mission as a “royal emissary” sent by Virginia Governor Robert Dinwiddie to the contested Ohio Territory. A failed diplomatic mission, Governor Dinwiddie quickly published Washington’s report.

Washington, due to his notoriety, served as Braddock’s aide-de-camp. The British General was mortally wounded and later passed. Washington recalls in a letter to his Mother (Mary Ball Washington): “I luckily escaped without a wound, though I had four bullets through my coat, and two horses shot under me.”' },\n  { title:\n     'STOP #2 Ratzer Map (Confidential): A Young Colonel in New York (1756)',\n    slide:\n     '3. Dressed in his Virginia Regimental Uniform of buff-and-blue and accompanied by officers and attendants, Washington created sensation on his trip through New York.

Shirley in Boston).' },\n  { title:\n     'STOP #2 Ratzer Map (Confidential): A Young Colonel in New York (1756)',\n    slide:\n     '4. New York was different from the genteel Virginia society and Western territories GW was accustomed to. The city was acenter of imperial culture, as profits came in from provisions provided to stationed troops, as well as illicit trade with French Caribbean Islands. New York merchants had grown extremely wealthy- in 1756, Ben Franklin observed: “That New York is growing immensely rich, by Money bought into Quarters for the Pay and Subsistence of the Troops”.' },\n  { title:\n     'STOP #2 Ratzer Map (Confidential): A Young Colonel in New York (1756)',\n    slide:\n     '4.1 In particular, the firm of De Lancey & Watts greatly profited from direct connections to the British Army.

GW indulged in the luxury NYC had to offer, as his personal account books note pounds spent on horses, “Taylors Bill”or Tailor’s Bills, servants, and “Treating the ladies.”  One New York socialite, Mary Philipse (of the Morris-Jumel Mansion fame), supposedly caught the attention of the young Colonel during his visit. Introduced through Washington’s host, Beverly Robinson, there is no definite answer on the extent of their relationship. It is speculated Washington was a suitor to Mary Philipseand may have proposed, but no known correspondences exist between the two.' },\n  { title:\n     'STOP #2 Ratzer Map (Confidential): A Young Colonel in New York (1756)',\n    slide:\n     '5.1 Philipse later married Colonel Roger Morris in 1758, Morris was an acquaintance of Washington’s from the Braddock campaign.

Washington never receiving a formal education himself, sought fit that John gain one as heir to Mount Vernon.

Prior to Washington’s visit in 1773, discontent among New Yorkers and the colonies as a whole began to grow- as colonists felt their rights as British citizens were under attack. Debt-ridden from the Seven Years’ War, Parliament began directly passing a series of taxes on the colonies, contrary to the ideal that only direct representatives from local government could pass taxes on the colonists. Taxes such as: The Stamp Act of 1765 on papered goods and The Townshend Act of 1767 on British imported goods (paint, glass, TEA, etc…) Aware of colonists’ protests, Parliament repealed the taxes- but the damage had been done.' },\n  { title:\n    'STOP #3 Washington’s Headquarters Flag (Flag Gallery): Revolutionary Beginnings (1773 - 1775)',\n    slide:\n    '3.1 New York City was a center of protest in the years leading up to the Revolution. Mainly lead by the Sons of Liberty, encounters include: the creation and burning of an effigy of Royal Governor Cadwallader Colden at Bowling Green following the Stamp Act (1765), The Battle of Golden Hill- which may be seen as the first clash between colonists and redcoats (Jan 19, 1770), and the New York Tea Party (1774).' },\n  { title:\n    'STOP #3 Washington’s Headquarters Flag (Flag Gallery): Revolutionary Beginnings (1773 - 1775)',\n    slide:\n    '4.

Washington promptly paid for his step-son’s college expenses and met with King’s College President Myles Cooper (a vocal Loyalist who later fled to England in 1775), requesting he watch over John Custis. During his visit, Washington attended a social gathering given in honor of General Thomas Gage- then Commander of the British troops in North America. GW served with Gage during the Braddock campaign in 1755, and before the close of his trip the two gentlemen once again met up for a small dinner.

The year 1775 was pivotal not only George Washington, but for the colonies as a whole. On June 15, 1775 Washington was unanimously chosen as Commander-in-Chief of the newly formed Continental Army. John Adams, who nominated GW, writes: “I can now inform you that the Congress have made Choice of the modest and virtuous, the amiable, generous and brave George Washington Esqr., to be the General of the American Army… This Appointment will have a great Effect, in cementing and securing the Union of these Colonies”. Beating out opponents for the position such as John Hancock, Washington’s appointment was due to his serviceduring the Seven Years’ War and the belief that a leader from Virginia could unite the colonies towards one common cause.' },\n  { title:\n    'STOP #3 Washington’s Headquarters Flag (Flag Gallery): Revolutionary Beginnings (1773 - 1775)',\n    slide:\n    '6.

The subsequent months left both the colonial and British armies at a stalemate.

Washington arrived to New York City in mid-April of 1776 to oversee military  preparations [the General’s first recorded visit to Fraunces Tavern was on April 13, 1776]. Most able-bodied men, servants, and enslaved people were pressed into constructing fortifications all throughout the city. Additional structures were built along Upper Manhattan, Brooklyn, Governors Island, and NJ to prevent enemy entry. Yet, Manhattan surrounded by Hudson and East Rivers and New York Harbor led Washington to the conclusion that not all of New York could be protected. The unprotected shorefront presented the larger problem, as the Continental Congress had not assembled a Navy. In agreement with Congress, in order to boost American morale (as public opinion remained neutral), Washington fortified New York to the best of his ability.' },\n  { title:\n    'STOP #4 The Pulling Down of the King George III Statue (Fear and Force): Independence (1776)',\n    slide:\n    '2. As preparations were underway those with no allegiance to either side and Tory sympathizers still inhibited the city.The Knickerbocker families of New York such as the Stuyvesants and the De Lanceys found their Townhouses over run by American soldiers, using their properties for supplies and stationing horses in their gardens. [Such as the case of Oliver De Lancey, who ordered patriot woodcutters off his property, in return the army burned his beloved orchards- the De Lancey family had sided with the English during the war.] Additionally, Washington ordered: “women, children, and infirmed persons in the City of New York to be immediately removed from the city.” This included residents of almshouse within the city.' },\n  { title:\n    'STOP #4 The Pulling Down of the King George III Statue (Fear and Force): Independence (1776)',\n    slide:\n    '3.

Within a 24-hour period, nine-thousand or so redcoats began to set about fortifying Staten Island. As tensions ran high among both sides, Washington urged his men to be ready at a moments notice. Shortly after the British appeared on NY shores, the Continental Congress in Philadelphia voted in favor of independence on July 2nd and adopted the Declaration of Independence, two days later on July 4th. The NY Provincial Congress approved of the document on July 9th and later that same day, under Washington’s general orders: “The several brigades are to be drawn up this evening on their respective Parades, at six OClock, when the declaration of Congress, shewing the grounds & reasonsof this measure, is to be read with an audible voice.” The Declaration was read to Washington’s troops at the city commons (modern-day City Hall park), soldiers and civilians rallied behind Independence- to the point in which a mob developed.' },\n  { title:\n    'STOP #4 The Pulling Down of the King George III Statue (Fear and Force): Independence (1776)',\n    slide:\n    '5.

One of his most important contributions was the development of a Presidential Cabinet: Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, and Attorney General Edmund Randolph. The capital moved from NYC to Philadelphia in the Summer of 1790 and with it, Washington and his family. The rest of his Presidency was fought over international and domestic affairs suchas trade with the British, the issue of the French Revolution, dealings with European empires in Western Territories, and building the foundation of the United States government as a whole...' },\n  { title:\n    '10.
